# Notes-App
An android app that creates and store notes in an SQLite database
 It implements a list view to bind data to the front view the picks data from the database and content provider. 
A very simple UI.
It is based on android studio although with some modifications can run on other ides. Just build and sync in your ide.
But ensure you have the required dependencies on disk or downloaded from maven online repos. 
For a more advanced implementation, you can replace the list view with a more modern RecylcerView.
